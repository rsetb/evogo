 * Plugin build config — ESM library mode.
 *
 * React is EXTERNALIZED: the host provides react/react-dom at runtime.
 * Bundling React here breaks hooks and ErrorBoundary across the host boundary.
 *
 * @evoapi/evonexus-ui is BUNDLED into the plugin output so the tarball is self-contained.
 * This means tokens.css is not auto-injected — the host injects it once for all plugins.
 *
 * Distribution: build output (dist/) + plugin.yaml + migrations/ + README.md -> tarball.
